Inspiration: 
I've always found that simple games are the most fun. My inspiration behind this idea stems from my enjoyment of simple, easy to play games and passion for competitiveness. I have never attempted to build something like this and I can't think of a better way to put my skills to the test than to build one for my final project.

Description:
